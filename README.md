# vue-dinosaur-fight

This is a simple exercise to practice and learn Vue. You fight two dinosaurs against each other. It's probably more fun to play with another person.

NOTE: Confidence counts for both how much damage you're giving as well as how much damage you're taking!

To use:
1) Clone the repo
2) npm install
3) npm run start
4) open http://localhost:8080
